## SQL Examples

    
    
    # Connect to Postgres
    psql postgres://postgres:postgres@0.0.0.0:5432/postgres
    
    
    -- create the extension in the "pgmq" schema
    CREATE EXTENSION pgmq;

### Creating a queue

Every queue is its own table in the `pgmq` schema. The table name is the queue
name prefixed with `q_`. For example, `pgmq.q_my_queue` is the table for the
queue `my_queue`.

    
    
    -- creates the queue
    SELECT pgmq.create('my_queue');
    
    
     create
    -------------
    
    (1 row)
    

### Send two messages

    
    
    -- messages are sent as JSON
    SELECT * from pgmq.send(
      queue_name  => 'my_queue',
      msg         => '{"foo": "bar1"}'
    );

The message id is returned from the send function.

    
    
     send
    -----------
             1
    (1 row)
    
    
    
    -- Optionally provide a delay
    -- this message will be on the queue but unable to be consumed for 5 seconds
    SELECT * from pgmq.send(
      queue_name => 'my_queue',
      msg        => '{"foo": "bar2"}',
      delay      => 5
    );
    
    
     send
    -----------
             2
    (1 row)
    

### Read messages

Read `2` message from the queue. Make them invisible for `30` seconds. If the
messages are not deleted or archived within 30 seconds, they will become
visible again and can be read by another consumer.

    
    
    SELECT * FROM pgmq.read(
      queue_name => 'my_queue',
      vt         => 30,
      qty        => 2
    );
    
    
     msg_id | read_ct |          enqueued_at          |              vt               |     message
    --------+---------+-------------------------------+-------------------------------+-----------------
          1 |       1 | 2023-08-16 08:37:54.567283-05 | 2023-08-16 08:38:29.989841-05 | {"foo": "bar1"}
          2 |       1 | 2023-08-16 08:37:54.572933-05 | 2023-08-16 08:38:29.989841-05 | {"foo": "bar2"}
    

If the queue is empty, or if all messages are currently invisible, no rows
will be returned.

    
    
    SELECT * FROM pgmq.read(
      queue_name => 'my_queue',
      vt         => 30,
      qty        => 1
    );
    
    
     msg_id | read_ct | enqueued_at | vt | message
    --------+---------+-------------+----+---------
    

### Pop a message

    
    
    -- Read a message and immediately delete it from the queue. Returns an empty record if the queue is empty or all messages are invisible.
    SELECT * FROM pgmq.pop('my_queue');
    
    
     msg_id | read_ct |          enqueued_at          |              vt               |     message
    --------+---------+-------------------------------+-------------------------------+-----------------
          1 |       1 | 2023-08-16 08:37:54.567283-05 | 2023-08-16 08:38:29.989841-05 | {"foo": "bar1"}
    

### Archive a message

Archiving a message removes it from the queue and inserts it to the archive
table.

    
    
    -- Archive message with msg_id=2.
    SELECT pgmq.archive(
      queue_name => 'my_queue',
      msg_id     => 2
    );
    
    
     archive
    --------------
     t
    (1 row)
    

Or archive several messages in one operation using `msg_ids` (plural)
parameter:

First, send a batch of messages

    
    
    SELECT pgmq.send_batch(
      queue_name => 'my_queue',
      msgs       => ARRAY['{"foo": "bar3"}','{"foo": "bar4"}','{"foo": "bar5"}']::jsonb[]
    );
    
    
     send_batch 
    ------------
              3
              4
              5
    (3 rows)
    

Then archive them by using the msg_ids (plural) parameter.

    
    
    SELECT pgmq.archive(
      queue_name => 'my_queue',
      msg_ids    => ARRAY[3, 4, 5]
    );
    
    
     archive 
    ---------
           3
           4
           5
    (3 rows)
    

Archive tables can be inspected directly with SQL. Archive tables have the
prefix `a_` in the `pgmq` schema.

    
    
    SELECT * FROM pgmq.a_my_queue;
    
    
     msg_id | read_ct |          enqueued_at          |          archived_at          |              vt               |     message     
    --------+---------+-------------------------------+-------------------------------+-------------------------------+-----------------
          2 |       0 | 2024-08-06 16:03:41.531556+00 | 2024-08-06 16:03:52.811063+00 | 2024-08-06 16:03:46.532246+00 | {"foo": "bar2"}
          3 |       0 | 2024-08-06 16:03:58.586444+00 | 2024-08-06 16:04:02.85799+00  | 2024-08-06 16:03:58.587272+00 | {"foo": "bar3"}
          4 |       0 | 2024-08-06 16:03:58.586444+00 | 2024-08-06 16:04:02.85799+00  | 2024-08-06 16:03:58.587508+00 | {"foo": "bar4"}
          5 |       0 | 2024-08-06 16:03:58.586444+00 | 2024-08-06 16:04:02.85799+00  | 2024-08-06 16:03:58.587543+00 | {"foo": "bar5"}
    

### Delete a message

Send another message, so that we can delete it.

    
    
    SELECT pgmq.send('my_queue', '{"foo": "bar6"}');
    
    
     send
    -----------
            6
    (1 row)
    

Delete the message with id `6` from the queue named `my_queue`.

    
    
    SELECT pgmq.delete('my_queue', 6);
    
    
     delete
    -------------
     t
    (1 row)
    

### Drop a queue

Delete the queue `my_queue`.

    
    
    SELECT pgmq.drop_queue('my_queue');
    
    
     drop_queue
    -----------------
     t
    (1 row)
    

## Configuration

### Partitioned Queues

You will need to install
[pg_partman](https://github.com/pgpartman/pg_partman/) if you want to use
`pgmq` partitioned queues.

`pgmq` queue tables can be created as a partitioned table by using
`pgmq.create_partitioned()`.
[pg_partman](https://github.com/pgpartman/pg_partman/) handles all maintenance
of queue tables. This includes creating new partitions and dropping old
partitions.

Partitions behavior is configured at the time queues are created, via
`pgmq.create_partitioned()`. This function has three parameters:

`queue_name: text`: The name of the queue. Queues are Postgres tables
prepended with `q_`. For example, `q_my_queue`. The archive is instead
prefixed by `a_`, for example `a_my_queue`.

`partition_interval: text` \- The interval at which partitions are created.
This can be either any valid Postgres `Duration` supported by pg_partman, or
an integer value. When it is a duration, queues are partitioned by the time at
which messages are sent to the table (`enqueued_at`). A value of `'daily'`
would create a new partition each day. When it is an integer value, queues are
partitioned by the `msg_id`. A value of `'100'` will create a new partition
every 100 messages. The value must agree with `retention_interval` (time based
or numeric). The default value is `daily`. For archive table, when interval is
an integer value, then it will be partitioned by `msg_id`. In case of duration
it will be partitioned on `archived_at` unlike queue table.

`retention_interval: text` \- The interval for retaining partitions. This can
be either any valid Postgres `Duration` supported by pg_partman, or an integer
value. When it is a duration, partitions containing data greater than the
duration will be dropped. When it is an integer value, any messages that have
a `msg_id` less than `max(msg_id) - retention_interval` will be dropped. For
example, if the max `msg_id` is 100 and the `retention_interval` is 60, any
partitions with `msg_id` values less than 40 will be dropped. The value must
agree with `partition_interval` (time based or numeric). The default is `'5
days'`. Note: `retention_interval` does not apply to messages that have been
deleted via `pgmq.delete()` or archived with `pgmq.archive()`. `pgmq.delete()`
removes messages forever and `pgmq.archive()` moves messages to the
corresponding archive table forever (for example, `a_my_queue`).

In order for automatic partition maintenance to take place, several settings
must be added to the `postgresql.conf` file, which is typically located in the
postgres `DATADIR`. `pg_partman_bgw.interval` in `postgresql.conf`. Below are
the default configuration values set in Tembo docker images.

Add the following to `postgresql.conf`. Note, changing
`shared_preload_libraries` requires a restart of Postgres.

`pg_partman_bgw.interval` sets the interval at which `pg_partman` conducts
maintenance. This creates new partitions and dropping of partitions falling
out of the `retention_interval`. By default, `pg_partman` will keep 4
partitions "ahead" of the currently active partition.

    
    
    shared_preload_libraries = 'pg_partman_bgw' # requires restart of Postgres
    pg_partman_bgw.interval = 60
    pg_partman_bgw.role = 'postgres'
    pg_partman_bgw.dbname = 'postgres'
    

## Visibility Timeout (vt)

pgmq guarantees exactly once delivery of a message within a visibility
timeout. The visibility timeout is the amount of time a message is invisible
to other consumers after it has been read by a consumer. If the message is NOT
deleted or archived within the visibility timeout, it will become visible
again and can be read by another consumer. The visibility timeout is set when
a message is read from the queue, via `pgmq.read()`. It is recommended to set
a `vt` value that is greater than the expected time it takes to process a
message. After the application successfully processes the message, it should
call `pgmq.delete()` to completely remove the message from the queue or
`pgmq.archive()` to move it to the archive table for the queue.
